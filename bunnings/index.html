                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p class="body-text">Bunnings customers' number one problem was finding products in their massive stores. At the same time, team members were spending most of their time guiding customers to product locations, limiting their time for more important work tasks.</p>

                    <h3>My role</h3>
                    <p class="body-text">Product design lead and strategist – I led a small team of product owners, engineers and researchers to develop and scale a solution. After the launch of an initial app, I then continued to lead design and played a key role in product strategy to launch several updates and a companion app for tradespeople.</p>

                <div class="info-section">
                    <h3>Approach</h3>
                    <p class="body-text">I led the core team through a series of rapid design sprints and a live beta trial with 738 customers that included a feedback loop that helped build confidence in before launching. After a successful release, I turned attention to revenue-generating opportunities that dovetailed with genuine customer problems.</p>

                <div class="info-section">
                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    <p class="body-text">After initially being shelved, the app was unexpectedly fast-tracked for release as a COVID-19 tool to minimise contact time between the public and Bunnings team members in their stores. Almost immediately after its release, the Product Finder app hit #1 on the Australian app store for shopping apps and received huge media praise. The app went on to lay the foundations for a mobile ecommerce channel for Bunnings, as well as a hugely successful partner app for professional tradies.</p>

                <p class="body-text">The beta trial was a huge success, and gave us a projected app rating, indication of retention rate and qualitative insights to use moving forward.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Despite the success, the Product Finder app was disappointingly deprioritised, as the company decided to direct all funding towards a new ecommerce re-platform… But thankfully, all was not lost – and news of the COVID-19 pandemic provided the app with new strategic importance.</p>
                <p class="body-text">By repositioning the app as a way to minimise in-store contact time, it became a critical component of Bunnings' essential service strategy: helping secure government permission to keep stores open while competitors were forced to close.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The project was rapidly reprioritised, accelerating our delivery timeline and transforming the app from a customer convenience to a business-critical service that helped Bunnings weather the pandemic while capturing great reviews and media praise.</p>

                <p class="body-text">Rather than integrate a traditional ecommerce funnel (which would risk leading to a duplicate experience of the Bunnings website), I successfully pitched the idea of a location-based app experience, which would recognise if the user was in a store or not and provide the most-relevant experience.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The "in-store design" would preserve the core Product Finder app experience that made it so successful and focus more on helping users find products in the store. The "out of store" design would lean more-heavily towards an online retail experience, allowing users to easily purchase items online.</p>

                <p class="body-text">We created a new experience that allowed them to scan and purchase products from the store all within the app. After purchasing, the app generates a digital receipt to show the store staff upon exit, allowing tradies to completely bypass long checkout lines.</p>

                <p class="body-text">Most importantly, I learned the value of maintaining a constant focus on the core problem. When we work in experimental environments with lots of freedom, it's easy to get carried away with cool ideas just because we can.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Maintaining a regular feedback cycle with users – not just for usability, but also for sentiment analysis on features and capabilities – meant that the final product struck an amazing balance between solving a genuine customer need and creating a new successful & scalable revenue opportunity for the business.</p>
